NINI BINARY RELEASE FILES
-------------------------

are the official files that are recommended for use in your production 
applications.

DIRECTORIES

Note that there are several layers of directories in the Bin directory.  Each 
directory corresponds to a special version of Nini.  Here is an explanation 
of each directory:

- DotNet directory
This contains all Windows Nini binaries.  Underneath this directory is a 
directory for each subversion fo the framework (i.e. "1.0", "1.1", etc for 
the 1.0 and 1.1 version of the .NET Framework.  It is recommended that you 
use the binary that is appropriate for your development environment.  

- DotNetCompact directory
This contains all Windows .NET Compact Framework binaries.  

- Mono directory
This contains all Mono binaries.  Read about the Mono project here:

http://www.mono-project.com/

These binaries should run on any platform that Mono runs on.  This currently 
includes Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.  SPARC and AMD64 support if not alreadly 
complete will be coming soon.
